### Reflection

Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

* The topics in the first lab really did help me on the project. I didnt get to fully complete the other labs due to time and us needing to get the project completed, but im sure it would have helped. 

If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
* If I had more time, I would have added more attractions, photos, and food guide places. I would have also changed the font and bakground to make it a bit more easy to read. (update... I changed the font color)

Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

* One thing I noticed was that one of my peers added a youtube video embedded inside. I would like to try that out as well to see how it is done.
