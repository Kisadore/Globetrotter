                <strong>Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia known for its tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins, and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. Its capital, Bangkok, is a modern cityscape rising next to quiet canal and riverside communities. The country is also famous for its vibrant street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its notorious nightlife. Thailand's economy is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of its gross domestic product (GDP). Thai cuisine has become internationally renowned for its enthusiastic use of fresh herbs and spices. Tourism also contributes significantly to the Thai economy, with visitors drawn to the country's beaches, islands, cultural treasures, and natural beauty.</strong>
